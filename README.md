# Client-Server
Great network tools 

In a client-server model, devices interact over a network. Clients request services/resources from servers, which process these requests and send responses back. Communication occurs via protocols like TCP/IP. Servers handle multiple requests, employing techniques like load balancing for scalability. Security measures protect data exchange. This model enables efficient communication and resource sharing over networks.
